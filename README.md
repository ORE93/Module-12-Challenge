## Background
Credit risk poses a classification problem that’s inherently imbalanced. This is because healthy loans easily outnumber risky loans. In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate models with imbalanced classes. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## What You're Creating
Using your knowledge of the imbalanced-learn library, you’ll use a logistic regression model to compare two versions of the dataset. First, you’ll use the original dataset. Second, you’ll resample the data by using the RandomOverSampler module from the imbalanced-learn library.

For both cases, you’ll get the count of the target classes, train a logistic regression classifier, calculate the balanced accuracy score, generate a confusion matrix, and generate a classification report.

As part of your GitHub repository, you will create a credit risk analysis report based on the template provided in your Starter_Code folder.

You can find my analysis under the Analysis-Report markdown file included in the repository.

## Technologies
Jupyter Notebook for the coding.
Pandas for the DataFrames.
Sklearn for the machine learning.
